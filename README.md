# Poker Game Algorithm

Algorithm in C++ programming language to determine the winners of a thousand Poker hands contained in the 'poker.txt' file. The thousand hands were generated randomly for two players. Each line of the file contains ten cards, separated by spaces: the first five cards belong to the first player and the next five belong to the second player. All hands are valid, i.e., there are no invalid characters or repeated cards. The four suits of the cards were coded as C (hearts), D (diamonds), P (spades) and T (clubs). The 10 was encoded as a 0.
